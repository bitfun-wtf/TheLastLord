# The Last lord
**The Last Lord** is a multiplayer online web-based MMORPG operating on Fractal Bitcoin, developed by the BitFun team. The game is inspired by BrowserQuest, originally created by the Mozilla Foundation and Little Workshop 12 years ago. Building upon this foundation, we have rewritten the code, redesigned the maps, and integrated the Bitcoin ecosystem, creating a seamless fusion of Bitcoin and gaming to "Make Bitcoin Fun Again!"

## Features
Here are the new features and gameplay elements we've incorporated:
- A more stable and efficient bidirectional, low-latency communication engine using socket.io, enabling a seamless multiplayer experience.
- A comprehensive quest and achievement system.
- Real-time rendering of expansive maps.
- Pet functionality.
- Token staking feature.
- Advanced skill system.
- Equipment upgrade system.
- PvP system.

## Real-time Rendering and Anti-cheat System
To prevent cheating and malicious activities, we have invested significant effort in developing a real-time rendering system. This ensures that maps are generated in real-time based on player actions and returned from the server, with both server and client performing game data security checks.

## Public Test
We will launch a public test in September, open to everyone without any application required. Game website : https://thelastlord.games/
This test aims to verify the game's stability and core functionalities, including:
- Client-server response stability.
- Real-time map rendering system.
- Combat system.
- Equipment system.
- Achievement system.
- Quest system.
- Chat system.
- Teleportation system.

Test accounts will be linked to Bitcoin wallet addresses, so players will need to download the Unisat or OKX Wallets plugins.

During the public test, all equipment can be obtained by defeating monsters, giving players a chance to experience various gear. However, in the official release, high-level equipment will require token upgrades.

Additionally, the gold obtained by players during the public test will be tied to future airdrops. You can claim airdrops directly in the game, which will be sent to your game account's registered address!

Please note that the data from the public test will be wiped before the official launch. 

## No Man's Land
No Man's Land is the game's first expansion pack. In this expansion, we will unlock all maps and introduce:
- Pet system.
- Token staking system.
- Equipment upgrade system.
- PvP system.
- Guild system.

This marks the official launch of the game, giving players access to the complete GameFi system. Additionally, the first season of the game will begin.

### Cross-platform Play
We aim to let mobile users enjoy The Last Lord as well. Therefore, we are developing a PWA version, allowing players to play on both web and mobile platforms after the official launch.

### Open Source
Thanks to the open-source nature of BrowserQuest, The Last Lord was made possible. Therefore, we will open-source the public test version of the game after the official launch for other teams to study and learn from.
